## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.postimg.cc/J7Xf9rPX/Screenshot-2025-03-31-at-18-53-48-Code-Sharing-App.png)

In this project the user can share their code script and get a link for they to use it however they want to.

- At this time, the project is not hosted on a server to view the demo.
- I had a great time doing this project, learned a lot, and made progress on my path to becoming a Spring Boot developer.
- I learned how to manage file sending, in this case code, and save them on the server with Spring Boot.
- Your wisdom? :)
